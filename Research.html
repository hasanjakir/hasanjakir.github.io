								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<blockquote>This paper proposes a capacitive bridge-type superconducting fault current limiter (CB-SFCL) 
										to address the most concerning issue with the grid connected hybrid power system by improving 
										the transient performance. The hybrid system incorporates a doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) 
										based wind farm, a solar photovoltaic (PV) system and a synchronous generator (SG) based power 
										system. The CB-SFCL incorporates a high temperature superconductor (HTS) along with a power 
										capacitor to provide adequate reactive power support before and after the fault. The capacitor 
										is kept inactive during normal operation by a control circuit to ensure a seamless operation. 
										During fault, the capacitor gets connected in series with the HTS and suppress the fault current. 
										The performance of the CB-SFCL is investigated by proper graphical and mathematical analyses and 
										conclusions are obtained by comparing them with that of the conventional bridge-type superconducting 
										fault current limiter (BSFCL) and a capacitive bridge-type fault current limiter (CBFCL). 
										The analyses support the theoretical superiority of the CB-SFCL over the BSFCL and the CBFCL by a satisfying margin.</blockquote>

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<blockquote>Any fault related to grid is a matter of great concern for doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) 
										based power system as DFIGs stator windings are connected to the grid directly. To augment 
										the transient performance of the DFIGs, superconducting fault current limiter (SFCL) is a 
										certified device. To boost the performance of a flux-coupling-type SFCL (FC-SFCL) by ensuing 
										the adaptive use of fault current limiting impedance based on fault severity, rather involving 
										the full impedance unnecessarily, a nonlinear controller (NC) for FC-SFCL (NC-FC-SFCL) is presented 
										in this paper. Reason behind choosing a straightforward NC for this work is to have simple implementation 
										capability with the full flavor of a nonlinear controller. Effectiveness of the NC-FC-SFCL is compared 
										with conventionally controlled FC-SFCL for various fault scenarios. Simulation results suggest that, 
										NC-FC-SFCL can improve the overall fault ride through (FRT) capability which is verified both by graphically 
										and numerically. Additionally, this effective use of the fault limiting impedance guarantees better transient 
										sub-synchronous resonance (SSR) performance, and exhibits better total harmonic distortion responses.</blockquote>

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<blockquote>Doubly-fed induction generators (DFIGs) have drawn 
									prominent interest in the field of wind power generation, but they are vulnerable to grid faults. Grid codes mandate DFIGs to employ 
									a sort of fault ride-through (FRT) technique during faults. Fault current limiters (FCLs) always help to augment the FRT capability of DFIGs and a non-linear controller boosts their
									performances. In this study, a non-linear auto-regressive moving average-L2 (NARMA-L2) controller-based bridge-type flux
									coupling non-superconducting FCL (BFC-NSFCL) is proposed to enhance the FRT capability of the wind farm. The authors
									analysed the performance of the proposed NARMA-L2-based BFC-NSFCL (NL2-BFC-NSFCL) against that of the conventionally
									used series dynamic braking resistor (SDBR), bridge-type FCL (BFCL), and proportional–integral (PI) controller-based BFCNSFCL (PI-BFC-NSFCL). 
									They tested the performance of the NL2-BFC-NSFCL through multiple temporary and permanent fault
									scenarios and carried out the mathematical and graphical analysis in MATLAB/Simulink platform. They found that the proposed
									NL2-BFC-NSFCL's performance surpasses the performances of the SDBR, the BFCL, and the PI-BFC-NSFCL. Moreover, the
									NL2-BFC-NSFCL has faster system recovery capability after the occurrence of any fault than other competitors.</blockquote>

								<h4>Abstract</h4>
								<blockquote>This paper demonstrates the design of robust proportional resonant (PR) controller using negative imaginary (NI) theorem
									for voltage control of three-phase islanded microgrid (MG) application. While operating MG as the islanded mode, different
									types of random and unknown load dynamics affect the MG. These loads eventually deteriorate the proper execution of
									MG-inducing disturbances in voltage and current. Therefore, to improve the performance of the three-phase MG, a simple,
									second-order controller is designed with the combination of NI theory and PR (NI–PR) controller. This controller is capable
									of providing higher level of damping as well as excellent stability properties. The stability and effectiveness of this controller
									are examined through imposing uncertainties, in terms of several load dynamics as well as different fault conditions. The
									comparison with respect to linear quadratic regulator and model predictive controller also ascertains the robustness of the
									designed controller. The NI–PR controller and the system are simulated in MATLAB/SIMULINK platform.</blockquote>

							<blockquote>Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) are vulnerable to grid related electrical faults.
								Standards require DFIGs to be disconnected from the grid unless augmented with a fault ride through (FRT)

							<h4>Abstract</h4>
							<blockquote>High penetration of Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) into existing power grid
								can attribute complex issues as they are very sensitive to the grid faults. In addition, Fault Ride
								Through (FRT) is one of the main requirements of the grid code for integrating Wind Farms

								Moreover, a dynamic nonlinear controller is also proposed for controlling the operation of the

								results and different numerical analysis, it is found that the proposed nonlinear controller based
								BFC-NSFCL is very effective in enhancing the FRT capability of the WF. Also, the BFC-NSFCL

							<h4>Abstract</h4>
							<blockquote>Doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) have
								some enthralling features which made them one of the most
								popular choices in power system. However, any kind of system
								abnormalities will directly affect the DFIGs as their stator
								windings are directly linked to the grid. To comply with the grid
								code, every DFIG based wind farms are required to ride
								through the fault keeping the healthy part of the system
								undisturbed. So, fault ride through (FRT) capability
								improvement is a mandatory requirement for every DFIG based

								have been popular for decades in this regard. In this paper, a
								new hybrid superconducting fault current limiter (HSFCL)
								with bias magnetic field is put forth. The HSFCL is designed by
								combining a double split reactor with a high temperature
								superconducting (HTS) magnet which is non-inductive. For the
								validation, its performance has been compared with that of
								bridge-type fault current limiter (BFCL) and series dynamic

							<h4>Abstract</h4>
							<blockquote>In last few years, the most accepted and
								prominent choice in wind farm technology is Doubly Fed
								Induction Generators (DFIGs). But it is vulnerable to faults,
								especially which relate to grid, as its stator winding is directly
								attached to the grid. For uninterrupted supply of power, the
								DFIG requires to be connected to the grid during the faults
								according to the grid code. Hence, improving the Fault Ride
								Through (FRT) capability is one of the major concerns to ensure
								the stable operation of DFIG based wind farms. This paper is
								focused on the performance of various converter-inverter
								topologies for transient stability analysis of DFIG. Thus far, two
								level and three level neutral point clamped converter-inverter
								topologies have been implemented in FRT analysis. However,
								the analysis has not yet been performed for the two newly
								introduced advanced topologies i.e. flying capacitor and Zsource model. 
								Simulations had been executed using
								PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform. The effect of different
								converter-inverter topologies on the terminal voltage and the
								DC-link voltage were demonstrated and compared. Simulation
								results show that flying capacitor model outperforms all the
