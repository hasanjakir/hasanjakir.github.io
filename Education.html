								<h3>Bachelor of Science in Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE)</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="photos/RUET_logo.png" width="#" height="#" alt="" /></span>
									Completed a four year long bachelor program in Electrical and Electronc Engineering with Power Systems 
								major. The completion of the course cost me a lot of sweats and sleepless nights. It gave me stress that I 
								could barely endure. The program was divided in eight semesters and each semester had five theory courses and 
								necessary lab works related to them. During the eight semesters, I have learnt the courses that are related not
								only to EEE, but the courses from CSE, ME, IPE, Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Economics and Accountng to
								test our patience. Glad that I overcame all of them. </I></p>

								<h4>Some key points that are worth mentioning:</h4>
											<ul>
												<li>Completed my B.Sc. securing <b>CGPA 3.62</b> in a scale of <b>4.00</b>.</li>
												<li>Obtained a total of <b>160 credits</b>.</li>
												<li>Was a member of IEEE RUET student branch for more than two years.</li>

								A two year long program that ends with a public exam called Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) exam. It 
								laid the foundation of my interest in science and math. These two years ended pretty well. I learnt the art of self-learning 
								during this period. </p>

								<p>In the HSC exam, I secured <b>GPA 5.00</b> in a scale of <b>5.00</b> with the highest grade in all subjects.</p>

								<h3>Secondary School Certificate (SSC) in Science</h3>
								<p><span class="image left"><img src="photos/KHS_logo.jpg" width="#" height="#" alt="" /></span>
									Life was here. Best days of my life. Period.</p>
									<p>Studied class six to ten here. The final exam of class ten was a public exam called Secondary School Certificate (SSC) exam.
										There was a scholarship exam after the end of class eight where I achieved scholarship in talentpool. Life was simple, dreams 
										were just formulating. I could be anything I want back then, the dreams were so colorful, unlike now. Miss the time spent with
										my friends, miss the evening spent in the local library. It was the time that inspired my habit of reading. It was the time that shaped
										me who I am today. Grateful for the time here, grateful to this wonderful school. </p>
								
										<p>In the SSC exam, I secured <b>GPA 5.00</b> in a scale of <b>5.00</b> with the highest grade in all subjects.</p>
